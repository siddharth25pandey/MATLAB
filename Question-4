Write a matlab code for linear convolution of two signals. Then
1. Generate the causal signals
x1[n] = {−2
↑
, 2, 3, 1, 12}

x2[n] = {1
↑
, −1, 4, −2}
h[n] = {3
↑
, − 2, − 5, 1, − 4}
Now, determine the output of the given systems
y1[n] = (x1[n] + x2[n]) ∗ h[n]
y2[n] = x1[n] ∗ h[n] + x2[n] ∗ h[n]

(a) Perform the calculations using your matlab code and verify the re-
sults using the inbuilt function conv and on-paper calculations.

(b) Verify if the outputs y1[n] and y2[n] are identical or not.
(c) Using the stem function, plot the signals x1[n], x2[n], h[n], y1[n] and
y2[n].
2. Next, generate the translated signals
x[n] = {3, 3, 1
↑
, 2, 3, }
h[n] = {1, 2, 3
↑
, 2, 1}
Now, determine the output of the given system
y[n] = x[n] ∗ h[n]
1

(a) Perform the calculations using your matlab code and verify the re-
sults using the inbuilt function conv and on-paper calculations.

(b) Using the stem function, plot the signals x[n], h[n], and y[n].
3. Next generate the signals
x[n] = {2
↑
, − 1, 4, − 7, 5}

h[n] = {2
↑
, 4, 2, 4, 1}
Now, compute the ouput of the given systems
y1[n] = x[n] ∗ h[−n]
y2[n] = x[3 − n] ∗ h[n]

(a) Perform the calculations using your matlab code and verify the re-
sults using the inbuilt function conv and on-paper calculations.

(b) Using the stem function, plot the signals x[n], h[n], y1[n] and y2[n].
