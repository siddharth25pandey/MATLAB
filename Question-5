1. Write a matlab code for linear convolution of two time-limited continuous
signals and demonstrate its application on the following pair of signals
along with a theoretical validation

x(t) = exp(−2t)(u(t) − u(t − 4))

and

1 − t 0 ≤ t < 1
h(t) = t − 1 1 ≤ t < 2
0 elsewhere

2. Use the same convolution function to convolve the following signals. (The-
oretical verification is not necessary)

x(t) = ln(t)(u(t) − u(t − 3))

and

h(t) = exp(−t)(u(t) − u(t − 4))
