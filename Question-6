1. In the fundamental interval the signal x1(t) is defined as

x1(t) = 
1 −
t
2

(u(t + 1) − u(t − 1))
2. In the fundamental interval the signal x2(t) is defined as

x2(t) = t
2
(u(t + 1) − u(t − 1))

• For each of the periodic signals given above assume a time period T = 3
and compute the Fourier coefficients. Next, plot the following: The Fourier
coefficients; both the real and imaginary components vs the theoretical
values.
• Next, for each of the periodic signals mentioned above (with the period T
= 3), reconstruct the original signal from the Fourier coefficients.
– Plot the original and reconstructed signal on the same figure.
– Demonstrate the convergence of the reconstructed signal with respect
to the original signal
